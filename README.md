This is the source code for [danlechambre.com](https://danlechambre.com)

In it, you'll find a mix of code and original creative work. I make it public for the simple reason that I would not be where I am today were it not for those who did the same.

I hope it serves someone, somewhere, at some point in the future, as a learning aid or inspiration for their own projects.

For more information on how you can use the code in this repository see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md)

I'm no lawyer, but I've done my best to make clear what you should or shouldn't take from this repo, but if you're still in any doubt, please contact me at hi@danlechambre.com
