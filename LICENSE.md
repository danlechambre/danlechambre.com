## 2. Content and Media License

The following additional terms apply to "content" (even if that content is contained within a file also containing code), content should be taken to mean, anything that when taken together, constitutes a "creative work". The following is a non-exhaustive list:

### a. Written Content (Posts & Articles)

- You are welcome to quote and share excerpts, links, web mentions, and all that good indie web stuff, provided that you **attribute me** with a link back to the original source.
- You may not republish my articles or complete written works in full without prior permission.

### b. Original Artwork

- All original artwork (illustrations, graphics, images) is **fully copyrighted**.
- You may not copy, modify, or redistribute my original artwork without explicit permission, except as permitted by fair use laws (e.g., commentary, critique, or incidental inclusion in screenshots).
- You are welcome to link to the original source (which is assumed to be wherever I'm hosting this site right now).

### c. Interactive Digital Experiences (Apps, Games, etc.)

- An "interactive digital experience" should be taken to mean any code and/or assets that are mixed together in such a way as to create a distinct experience such as, but not limited to, a game or app.
- Code for digital works is made available for inspiration, adaptation and educational purposes, but taken as complete pieces, remain **copyrighted works**.
- You may analyze, discuss, and adapt portions for your own projects, but you may **not** copy, repackage, or distribute them as your own.
- If you adapt portions for your own projects, any adaptation must be transformative and substantially original. Mere modification does not constitute an original work. You may not copy substantial portions such that a reasonable person would deem the derivative work to be a **copy**.

## 3. General Guidelines for Use

- If you use code from this repository in your own projects, **attribution is appreciated**.
- If you're unsure about whether your intended use is permitted, please reach out and ask.
