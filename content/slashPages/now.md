I'm working as a Full-stack TypeScript Engineer at Hark by SolarEdge. When I'm not doing that I might be building Why Grief Matters.

I'm currently spending too much time on trains and too much money on commuting snacks.

I'm thinking a lot about building games for a living, but right now enjoying the things a steady job provides.

I'm learning piano.
