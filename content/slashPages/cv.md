_Striving to build digital experiences that delight. I mostly do this with **React** and **TypeScript**._

Iâ€™ve been building software professionally since the end of 2020. Backed by a decade in IT and InfoSec, and several years in retail, I bring a unique, human-centred perspective to app development. I focus on building digital experiences that are accessible, look great, and are blazingly fast. I thrive when part of a diverse team that values humility, creativity and quality when building the web.
