In the process of trying to organise my many hard drives into some sort of cohesive storage system I'd been digging around old projects. I stumbled upon a game I created back in early 2020 called Synthanoid. It was shortly after I'd left my career as an IT security guy, and was working towards doing dev as a job. The easiest way for me to stay engaged with learning to program was to build games. In fact if I could get away with being a penniless indie game dev, I probably would, alas, I like nice things (to my detriment I guess).

In any case, this simple block-breaking game was the first complete game I built. When I stumbled across this project, it was in and amongst a dozen or so half-baked abandoned prototypes, wreaking of the odour of short attention span and drenched in the ooze of lack of commitment. So this really stood out. What's particularly special about it to me, is it was done for no other reasons than for the fun of it, and to prove to myself I could finish a project with only that driving me.

It took me a weekend and I created all the assets including the music, so it's a complete, original work (well aside from the completely stolen idea of course ðŸ˜…). I even received an "Editor's Choice" on [Simmer](https://simmer.io).

The project can be found on [Github](https://github.com/danlechambre/Synthanoid) and a ~~WebGL build of the game is still up on Simmer~~ Simmer be no more.
