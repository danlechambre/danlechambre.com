Ugh! I hate the generative AI boom. I'm such a curmudgeon with these sorts of things. Deep down, we all know what's going to happen. Once the dust settles, there _will be_ a place for it, but at the moment we're still in the stage of "everything looks like an AI-solvable shaped nail".

On the classic adoption curve I would put myself down as an "early majority" adopter. Why is this important? Well, when Microsoft start [baking things in](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/05/19/advancing-windows-for-ai-development-new-platform-capabilities-and-tools-introduced-at-build-2025/) you know we're heading towards the top of the bell curve and it's probably time to jump on before getting left behind.

So start's the side-quest to learn _just enough, just in time_.
