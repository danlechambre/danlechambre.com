I'm just about to leave my current role in search of a new one. In my process of looking for a role I'll undoubtedly be checking off boxes on my imaginary perfect job check list. But what does that list look like?

Probably something like this:

- **Work to my strengths** - I'm a front-end engineer. It's the pointy end, but my favourite end. Others out there can take care of your other ends. Although I do love a bit of backend for frontend, everyone needs a BFF all (although is it an end when it's in the middle?).
- **Variety** - I don't need a new project thrown at me every month, but variety in the challenges and problems I'm solving keeps me sharp as a pin.
- **Make an impact** - I've only worked on one mothballed app. But that's enough to know I want my work to actually mean something and affect the world in some tiny way.
- **Work anywhere** - I'm a developer. I need only a laptop and minimal distractions to do my work. So I should be free to work wherever I like if it doesn't affect my productivity.
- **Work anytime** - Same as above but relating to locations in the 4th dimension. If I give 36 hours. Does it really matter when they happen?
- **Give me a Mac** - Please don't make me set up Node on Windows again, it just makes me a sad panda.
