Welcome. I'm Dan, a digital creative based in the North of England. My specialism, is generalism. I approach life and work with a polymathic spirit. I've no desire to be an expert at any one thing, but I do want to be as to close to the bottom of my bucket list as I can before my time on this ball of rock is up.

For the last few years, building for the web has held my interest and gets me paid. Right now I'm working as a _Full-Stack TypeScript Engineer_ for [Hark](https://harksys.com).

This site adopts a very loose [interpretation of the digital garden](/writing/interpretation-of-the-digital-garden), a concept made much easier to grok with [Maggie Appleton's research on the topic](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).
