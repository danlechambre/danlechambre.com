# Uses

## Hardware

- 14" MacBook Pro 2021
- Dell 32" 4k G3223Q monitor. One monitor. This is the way!
- Twelve South Curve laptop stand. I'd love to switch to the BookArc Flex or maybe even a custom stand so I could have my MacBook closed.
- Nuphy Halo 75 keyboard, but hoping to move to my ZSA Voyager very soon.
- Logitech Lift mouse for work. A Razer Viper (hypothetically) for gaming.
- CalDigit Element Hub
- MOTU M2 audio interface
- Desk itself is an IKEA SÃ„LJAN mounted to a Flexispot E5W standing desk frame.
- Chair is a truly awful Secret Lab Omega. Really don't know what I was thinking witg this one. Probably constrained budget at the time.

## Software

- VS Code with Night Owl theme. Extensions need review
- Figma for the very little design I do, much preferred Sketch tbh.
- Raycast

## Analogue

- Leuchtturm1917 A5 hardcover dotted notebook
- PILOT Hi-Tecpoint V5, various colours.
