Welcome. I'm Dan, a digital creative based in the North of England. I approach life and work with a polymathic spirit. I prioritise exploration and curiosity over mastery.

For the last few years, building for the web has held my interest and gets me paid. Right now I'm working as a _Full-Stack TypeScript Engineer_ for [Hark](https://harksys.com).

This site adopts a very loose [interpretation of the digital garden](/writing/interpretation-of-the-digital-garden), a concept made much easier to grok with [Maggie Appleton's research on the topic](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).
