Welcome. I'm Dan, a digital creative based in the North of England. Building for the web keeps me curious and keeps me paid. I approach life and work with a polymathic spirit but I prioritise exploration and curiosity over mastery.

This site collects together disparate parts of my creative journey; web projects, games, writing, the media that shapes and inspires me, as well as irl projects that feel like a good fit. It aligns with the idea of the [digital garden](/writing/interpretation-of-the-digital-garden), but you'll find no plant metaphors, just a loose free-form web of work and ideas in varying states of progress.
